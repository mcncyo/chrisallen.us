## New Syncthing Video on YouTube!

Yesterday, I posted my **2nd video about Syncthing** on YouTube. Check it out here: [Installing Syncthing on Linux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PXNxpdAvJM).

In this video, I walk you through the process of installing Syncthing on a Linux system. But that's not all—I have several more videos planned on Syncthing, including:

- **Installing Syncthing on Windows**
- **Setting up Syncthing on Android**
- **Advanced Syncthing Configuration**

I might even create a tutorial on how to **install the Syncthing relay service**. Stay tuned for more updates and tutorials on Syncthing by subscribing to my channel!
