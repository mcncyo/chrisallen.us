#### YouTube Videos

I recently filmed a comprehensive video on **how to use Syncthing**, and I’m currently in the editing phase. While I've encountered a few challenges in making it look polished, I aim to release it within the next couple of weeks. Additionally, I'm working on another video detailing the issues I faced while switching from a tower case to a 1U server case. Stay tuned for these informative updates!

#### Website Updates

I haven't been as diligent about updating this blog or **[ComputerHacking101.com](https://computerhacking101.com)** lately. My focus has been on setting up an automated system that pulls code from GitHub, builds the site using Hugo, and uploads the updated website. This new process will streamline updates and ensure more frequent content additions.
