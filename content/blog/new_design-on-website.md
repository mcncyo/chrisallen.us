# Website Updates and Features

We’re excited to announce some new features and a fresh theme for our website!

## New Features

- **Search Functionality**: We’ve added a search engine to make it easier for you to find information. Just click the magnifying glass in the top right corner to start searching.
- **Upcoming Enhancements**: We’re planning to introduce additional features soon to improve your browsing experience.

## Design Changes

- **Background Color**: Currently, the website has a white background. We’re working on reintroducing dark mode to provide an alternative viewing experience.

## Missing Pages

- **Page Updates**: Some pages might still be missing or under construction. We’re actively working to fix these issues and will have them resolved shortly.

Stay tuned for more updates and thank you for your patience!
