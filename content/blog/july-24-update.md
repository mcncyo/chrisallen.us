I’m still in the process of finding a new house within my hometown. We haven’t had much luck with our offers so far, so we’re considering building a house instead. We’ve talked to a company called UBuild It, but we’re still undecided about whether to go that route or just buy a house outright. We’re weighing our options and trying to figure out what’s best for us.

Work has been a bit of a mixed bag lately. Some days are incredibly busy, while others are quite slow. For the past couple of weeks, I’ve been focused on password resets for a new project. There are several other planned projects on the horizon, so it looks like I’ll be in for a busy end of the year.

On the home network front, I’ve switched from Proxmox to TrueNAS Scale for now. I might bring Proxmox back in the future, but I’ll need a new server for that. When I get the new server, I’ll install TrueNAS Scale on it and switch my current server back to Proxmox. One downside I’ve discovered with my current case is that it only supports 2.5-inch hard drives. I was hoping to expand my storage space with TrueNAS, but I’d get more value from using 3.5-inch drives in a new case. I do have another server motherboard on hand, so I just need to pick up RAM, a processor, and hard drives for it. I’m also considering making some new videos about my current setup for my Computer Hacking 101 page on YouTube.

I recently undertook a significant update to the website, including a complete overhaul of its theme. This redesign aimed to modernize the visual appeal and enhance user experience. In addition to the aesthetic changes, I made a notable shift in the website's development workflow. Instead of relying on Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment, I transitioned to using GitHub Actions. This change was driven by a desire to streamline the build process and take advantage of GitHub Actions' more seamless integration with the version control system. With GitHub Actions, I can automate the build and deployment processes more efficiently, leading to quicker updates and more reliable performance for the website.
