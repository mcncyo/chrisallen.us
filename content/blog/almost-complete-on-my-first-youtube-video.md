I am nearing completion of my first major YouTube video, "Dropbox vs. Syncthing." Most of the editing is done, and I still need to create a segment of the PowerPoint presentation that will accompany my narration. Additionally, I am working on the script for my next video, which will demonstrate how to install Syncthing on Linux. The corresponding webpage is almost finished, though I still have a lot to do for the "Dropbox vs. Syncthing" video.

I aim to release the first video this week, but I am also working 38 hours at my job, limiting my time for editing and recording. However, I can still work on the script and website during my free time.
