## How I’ve Been Keeping Busy: From Family Health to Tech Upgrades and Content Creation

Wow, what a whirlwind the past few weeks have been! With the holiday season in full swing and the added challenge of my grandma's hospital visits, it's been quite a hectic time. The good news is that she's now back home and relaxing, which brings a huge relief to our family.

While juggling these personal challenges, I've also been deeply immersed in some exciting projects. One of the biggest updates is the work I've been doing on my home network. I've been upgrading and optimizing it to enhance my online activities and content creation process. 

### Major Upgrades to My Home Network

As part of my network overhaul, I’ve been fine-tuning my website, [ComputerHacking101.com](https://computerhacking101.com), to better serve my audience. I’m thrilled to announce that I’ve set up a new subdomain: [links.computerhacking101.com](https://links.computerhacking101.com). This new subdomain will streamline the management of affiliate links and other updates, making it easier for you to find the resources you need.

### Exciting Content on the Horizon

In addition to these tech improvements, I’ve been working diligently on scripting a couple of new videos that I’m planning to release this month. These videos are designed to offer valuable insights and tips, and I can’t wait to share them with you. Stay tuned for updates!

### Wrapping Up

It’s been a busy period, but the progress on both my home network and content creation is incredibly rewarding. I’m looking forward to sharing more with you soon and appreciate your continued support.

Thanks for reading, and here’s to a productive and fulfilling end to the year!
