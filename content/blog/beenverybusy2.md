# Exciting Updates: New Projects and Recent Purchases

I've been incredibly busy with work and personal commitments recently, which has limited my time for YouTube and managing my websites. However, I’m thrilled to share that I've managed to release a few new videos on my [computer hacking 101](https://www.youtube.com/@computerhacking101). Looking ahead, I’ll be dedicating the next two weeks to focusing on some exciting projects.

## Upcoming Projects and Video Content

### Comprehensive Syncthing Tutorial

One of my major upcoming projects is a **comprehensive Syncthing tutorial**. This video will cover everything you need to know about [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net), including setup and practical uses. Stay tuned for in-depth insights into this powerful synchronization tool.

### Website Migration: WordPress to Hugo

I’m also in the process of **migrating both of my websites from WordPress to Hugo static sites**. This migration is aimed at enhancing performance and improving user experience. Hugo's speed and flexibility will provide a more streamlined and efficient platform for my content.

## Recent Purchases and Upgrades

I’ve recently made several upgrades to my tech setup, including:

- **1U Server Case**: I’m moving my Proxmox server into a new 1U server case. This upgrade required new heat sinks for my Proxmox CPUs, improving cooling and performance.
  
- **HP ProCurve 24-Port 1GB Switch**: This networking switch will significantly expand my network capabilities, allowing me to connect more devices and optimize network performance.
  
- **TP-Link Archer C9 Router**: I’ve installed DD-WRT firmware on my TP-Link Archer C9 v1. Although I plan to upgrade the router eventually, this setup will serve me well for the next few weeks to a couple of months.

Additionally, I’m planning to add a few **4 500GB hard drives** to my Proxmox server and create a **ZFS pool** for better data management and reliability.

## Stay Tuned

Keep an eye out for more updates and detailed videos on these exciting developments. Your support means a lot, and I can’t wait to share the results with you!
