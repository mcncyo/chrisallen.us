## Backup Challenges and Upcoming Projects

Lately, I've been dealing with some significant backup issues, which have unfortunately delayed my plans for the website and the next video in the Syncthing series for the Computer Hacking 101 channel. The backup problems have made it challenging to stay on top of my content creation schedule.

Starting Tuesday, I'll be back at work with my 8-to-5 contract job. This will limit my time to work on the website and YouTube channel, as my primary focus will be on this contract work. I need to prioritize this to provide for my family and to fund essential purchases for my YouTube projects.

I’m aiming to have the new video ready within the next week, but please understand that this timeline is subject to change based on how things go. In the meantime, I’ve also purchased a 1U rack mount case for my Proxmox server, which is currently housed in an old computer case from the early 2000s. I plan to document the installation process of this new rack mount case in an upcoming video. However, I want to ensure my office is well-organized before I start working on that video.

Additionally, I’m in the process of selling some items on eBay. Currently, you can view my listings at [this link](https://www.ebay.com/usr/computerhacking101). At present, there’s only one item available, but I plan to add more soon. These will include my collection of baseball cards, a USB 2.0 5-port PCI card, and a USB to PS/2 adapter.

Thank you for your patience and continued support as I work through these challenges and balance my various projects!
