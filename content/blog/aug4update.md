description: "Navigating project cancellations and server setup issues: the challenges of contract work and Proxmox server installations."
---
The past few weeks have been quite a rollercoaster. I recently encountered an unexpected setback when my contract work was abruptly canceled. The client, known for underestimating project costs, failed to account for the installation expenses this time as well. Unfortunately, this is a recurring issue with this client, who has a track record of initiating projects and leaving them unfinished.

In addition to these contract troubles, I’ve been grappling with some technical difficulties related to my 1U Proxmox server setup. When I initially purchased the server, I didn’t anticipate the need for a RAID interface. To make matters worse, some of the power cords provided were too short, and I was sent the incorrect CPU heatsink. On a positive note, a replacement heatsink is on its way and should arrive today, which should resolve part of the issue.

These challenges have been frustrating, but I’m hopeful that with a bit of patience and persistence, I’ll be able to overcome them and get everything back on track.
