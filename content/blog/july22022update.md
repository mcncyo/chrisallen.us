## Struggling with Back Pain and Balancing Work and YouTube Projects

Lately, I’ve been dealing with significant back pain, which has unfortunately slowed down my progress on my website and the creation of a new video on using Syncthing for Computer Hacking 101 websites. As I return to my 8 to 5 contract work starting Tuesday, my time for these projects will be limited. This contract work is essential for supporting my family and funding my YouTube channel.

I’m working on releasing a new video about Syncthing for Computer Hacking 101 websites. While I hope to have it ready within the next week, I can’t make any promises due to my current situation. Additionally, I’ve purchased a 1U rack mount case for my Proxmox server, which is currently in an old computer case from the early 2000s. I plan to create a video about installing the Proxmox server into the new rack mount case, but I need to clean up my office before I can start filming.

I’m also preparing to sell several items on eBay. You can check out what I currently have listed by visiting my eBay store at [https://www.ebay.com/usr/computerhacking101](https://www.ebay.com/usr/computerhacking101). Soon, I’ll be adding my collection of baseball cards, a USB 2.0 5-port PCI card, and a USB to PS/2 adapter.
