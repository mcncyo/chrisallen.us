## Thanksgiving Week Recap: A Tough Time and Looking Forward

### A Challenging Thanksgiving Week

Thanksgiving week has been quite difficult for me this year. We celebrated my birthday at my mother-in-law's house on Sunday. Unfortunately, I wasn't feeling my best then, and things took a turn for the worse on Monday. I ended up staying in bed almost all day from Monday through Thursday due to illness. To make matters worse, Wednesday was my birthday, which turned out to be quite a disappointing day.

### Job Search and YouTube Content

In other news, I'm still on the hunt for a computer job. The search continues, and I'm hopeful that I'll find the right opportunity soon. On top of that, I'm working on creating a few YouTube videos. However, my recent illness has slowed down my progress, and I haven't been able to work on them as much as I would have liked. Despite this setback, I aim to have at least one video published in the next couple of weeks.

Stay tuned for updates, and thank you for your patience and support!
