## Welcome to My New Website

Welcome to my new website, where I share insights and updates on a variety of topics I'm currently exploring. Whether you're interested in **Home Assistant**, **Android**, **Linux**, **Proxmox**, or **Catholic topics**, you'll find a range of articles and posts reflecting my current thoughts and projects.

In addition to this site, I am also working on [Computer Hacking 101](https://computerhacking101.com), which features a YouTube channel dedicated to **computer hacking** and **network optimization**. This platform offers comprehensive guides and tutorials on enhancing your computer systems and home network. Currently, I'm developing several tutorials on **Syncthing** for that site, designed to help you efficiently sync files and manage data across your devices.

Stay tuned for regular updates and valuable content that aims to enhance your tech skills and knowledge!
