## Seeking a Good-Paying Job and Gig Work Update

I am actively **searching for a high-paying job** and have recently attended several interviews. Unfortunately, most of the positions offered were either not a good fit or offered low pay.

In the meantime, I am engaging in gig work, including **DoorDash**, **Uber Eats**, and **GrubHub**, primarily in **West Wichita**. This helps me stay productive while continuing my job search.

### Current Projects

In addition to my job search, I am **working on improving my website** and contributing to [Computer Hacking 101](https://computerhacking101.com). I am also busy creating new content for my **YouTube channel**.

Feel free to check out my work and stay tuned for updates!
