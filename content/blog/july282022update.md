## Proxmox Server Upgrade: Challenges and Solutions

I recently embarked on upgrading my Proxmox server by transferring it to a 1U rack mount case, but I've encountered a few issues along the way.

### 1. Motherboard Stand-Offs Issue

One challenge is related to the motherboard stand-offs. I'll need to reposition them to fit the new case, but I've run into a small hiccup: I misplaced the specific wrench required for this task. I'm in the process of obtaining a replacement wrench set to resolve this issue.

### 2. Heat Sink Compatibility Problem

Another hurdle involves the heat sink. The heat sink company sent an incorrect part initially, and since the correct heat sink is coming from China, I'll have to wait a few weeks for delivery.

While these setbacks are inconvenient, addressing them is essential for a smooth Proxmox server upgrade. Stay tuned for further updates as I continue to work through these challenges and complete the migration.
