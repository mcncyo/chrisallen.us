I am currently planning to delay the installation of **pfSense** on my **Proxmox server**. Instead, I will focus on enhancing my website and working on the **YouTube videos** I have been creating. You can check out my work at [Computer Hacking 101](https://computerhacking101.com).

In the meantime, I am considering installing **pfSense** on another system. I have a few computers that I might use for this purpose. I am still undecided on whether to install **pfSense** directly on bare metal or to first install **Proxmox** and then set up **pfSense** within Proxmox.

Stay tuned for updates on my progress and additional content on my YouTube channel!
